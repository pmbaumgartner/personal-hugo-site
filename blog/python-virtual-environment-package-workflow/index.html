The factors that I’ve determined are critically important for choosing these tools are as follows:\n They work for me  Yep, that’s it. I haven’t actually done a thorough evaluation of what’s available. All I know is that this works for me and I hope if you’re reading this it’ll help you find something that works for you.\nManaging Python Versions \u0026 Virtual Environments: conda I use conda (installed via miniconda) to manage virtual environments and python versions installed on my computer. This mostly a historical artifact: when I started programming as a data scientist, the easiest way to get up and running with python was through the Anaconda installer. At the time (2014ish), there were some packages that were also easier to install via a conda install rather than a pip install, but I don’t think that’s been true since about 20171.\nIn short, I create environments with conda, then use pip install and a requirements.txt inside the environment. I do not use conda’s environment.yml file except in rare circumstances.\nThe command to create a new environment is conda create -n  python=. I do this often so I created a bash function for it (put this in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc).\ncreate_conda_env() {  DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION=\"3.8\"  conda create -n \"$1\" python=${2:-$DEFAULT_PYTHON_VERSION} } Then call it like this:\ncreate_conda_env new_env 3.9 I create environments per project, so the environment is usually associated with a folder of the same name. Using the above example, I’d make a folder called new_env. If you name the folder the same as the environment, you can do a 😎 cool trick 😎 where you activate the environment by the folder name by calling conda activate ${PWD##*/}. However, I don’t typically do this to activate the environment. Rather, I have it set up to automatically activate in VSCode and use the terminal there. To do this in VSCode, regardless of the folder name, open the command palette (⇧⌘P) and find Python: Select Interpreter. Select the environment you just created from this list. There is also a setting called Python › Terminal: Activate Env In Current Terminal you will want to turn on, otherwise sometimes the environment won’t activate if you have a terminal open in VSCode before the python extension loads.\nIf I’m doing a project that’s more analysis focused, or won’t result in a python package, I manually track the main packages installed. That is, if I need pandas, I’ll do a pip install pandas. Then I’ll check what version was installed with pip freeze | grep pandas and copy that line to my requirements.txt. I know I could install everything I need and then just do a big pip freeze  requirements.txt, but I use the requirements.txt to indicate to any other user of this project what packages are primarily used (i.e. anything that gets imported is in requirements.txt) and let any dependency versions resolve themselves when someone else does pip install -r requirements.txt.\nCreating Python Packages: poetry This is a newer addition to my workflow. For most of my work I’m not creating a python package, I’m just following the previous process with conda and making sure my repositories include a requirements.txt that allows someone else to execute my code.\nMore recently I have been creating packages using poetry. Here’s the main thing I like: it sets everything up so that relative and absolute imports ✨just work✨. Every time I’ve tried to create a package manually I get lost for days in Stack Overflow ImportError hell.2 The side effect of imports working correctly is that you also don’t have to worry about some PATH nonsense with your test suite! It sets up pytest and gives an example test that also ✨just works✨.\nHere’s how I use poetry with conda. I create a new virtual environment first, where the python version in that environment is the minimum I’ll choose to support for that package. Then I’ll activate that environment and pip install poetry. The side effect of this is that in the pyproject.toml file the python version will be set at the version you chose for that environment. This is better than installing poetry inside your base environment because it’ll use whatever version of python is there and that might not be what you want. After this, I will then use poetry for package and dependency management (not pip) by adding new packages with poetry add  so that the required packages are tracked in the pyproject.toml and poetry.lock files.\nThe command to create a new poetry package is:\npoetry new my-package However, this will create a new folder with the package name as well, so I run this command from the same “parent level” folder I’d be at if I was using conda and doing a regular mkdir to start a new project folder. The key is to not make the folder for your package before running poetry new, just let poetry handle that for you.\nFor package distribution, 90% of the time I’m just using a git repo and uploading it to github. You can install python packages from git repositories by prefixing the url with git+. This also works in requirements.txt files. The advantage here is that I am often rapidly changing parts of my packages early in development and I don’t want to manually track versions when changes occur so freqently. The downside is that a user can’t use pip install -U to update the package, they have to uninstall and reinstall from the repo.\nIf I’m working on a package that becomes a bit more stable and I want to publish it more widely, I’ll then upload to PyPI. One cool thing to know is that there’s a test version of PyPI called TestPyPI! This is awesome! You can practice uploading a package here and not worry about messing anything up on the official PyPI. There is a little bit of configuration needed to set this up with poetry, but it’s well worth it if you’re like me and rarely do the package publishing process.\nWrap Up That’s it! That’s how I use conda and poetry to manage python virtual environments and create python packages.\n  I was curious why this was so I did a little digging. I think can pin it down to the invention of wheels with binaries (circa 2013). This meant that the underlying non-python libraries used for things like numpy could be included in the package when things were installed with pip. Until this time, the ability to install system-specific precompiled binaries was conda’s selling point. I think it took a few years for packages in the data science python ecosystem to actually implement this (and users to realize it) before this became the mainstream way to install python packages if you were doing data science / scientific computing.

I have no idea what it is doing that makes it work and what I was doing incorrectly before that made it not work.
