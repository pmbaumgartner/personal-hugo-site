Agency Diversity – An individual jurisdiction can also have multiple courts, jails, and other agencies that maintain the same type of data but stored in different systems. Data Encoding Diversity – These data are often encoded in different ways across different systems, requiring reconciliation. Insufficient Data Definition – Jurisdictions or agencies might not define or capture specific data required for risk factors or outcomes if it’s not required for existing systems. e.g. Felony/Misdemeanor offense information is commonly captured, but violent/non-violent offense information is often not. An accurate lookup of whether an offense is violent might not exist. Definitional Diversity – Definitions of criminal history factors and severity may differ across jurisdictions. Intra-Agency System Changes – Agencies adopt new systems for the same data over time. This requires linking records for an individual across time. Legacy systems may not have every piece of requisite data for an accurate criminal history. Jurisdictions have different practices for archiving historical data from legacy data systems. For example, full criminal history information may be unavailable. Individual Data Veracity – The consistency of the data for any one individual varies across all of these systems. Reconciling various demographic descriptors (such as Hispanicity) across these systems has implications for determining predictive bias. Documentation Quality – Documentation about the data in different systems is often incomplete, out-of-date, or incorrect. Proprietary System Inconsistencies – Proprietary systems can store data in different formats and have different options for exporting data. Absence of New Data Storage – Scores from risk assessment instruments, as well as decisions made using them, aren’t stored in existing systems. This requires historical analysis (i.e. revalidation) based off risk factors where a real-time analysis with calculated assessment scores would be more precise.
